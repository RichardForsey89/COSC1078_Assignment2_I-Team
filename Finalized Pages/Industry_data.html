<h1>Has my opinion of my ideal job changed?</h1>
<p>
    <strong>Jai Wells</strong> - Studying the data at <a href="https://sites.rmit.edu.au/csit-careers/job-statistics/">https://sites.rmit.edu.au/csit-careers/job-statistics/</a> I have determined that my ideal job of Software Engineer is a realistic one, in high demand, with a reasonable salary and one that I have many of the required skills. From August 2018 - August 2019 there were 3,975 job listings posted across Australia and New Zealand, the highest in the tech industry. With a salary of $123K, Software Engineer is the third highest paying job in Computer Software Engineering & IT. The 5 highest in demand skills for software and programming are SQL, Java, JavaScript, Python and Linux - Of these I am currently learning SQL and Java at RMIT and independently learning Python, I intend to learn JavaScript as a part of a web development course at RMIT and I have foundational knowledge of Linux as I use it everyday for my general computing needs on my laptop but I likely need to improve skills required in using Linux in a business setting. The 5 highest in demand professional skills are: Communication, problem solving, planning, writing, and research - Of these I could stand to greatly improve my communication skills, I have  solid problem solving skills and require some improvement in research and planning, while I believe writing is not exactly my strong suit, my skills are adequate for writing emails and short correspondence to coworkers.

     <strong>Wen Guo</strong>-I didn't change my ideal job as designing, coding, and modifying websites is my interest, and I think the salary is very respectable as a graduate student. I will study web programming and cloud computing this year which I would learn how to design a good website，and I will work hard to reach my dream job.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Timothy Pan</strong>-Before meeting this group, I  wanted to be a teacher, and this decision will never change. As a group communicator, I think this is a good challenge for me to become a teacher. I'll move on to my goal.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Guanhong Chen</strong> - I don't want to change my mind, I still want to do work on network security, because according to the data, the average salary of network security engineers is very attractive, and there are many job opportunities. The most important thing is that I won't change my goal easily, and I'm just getting started</p>

<p><strong>Richard</strong> -
My ideal job preference has not changed as what has me interested in software development is primarily the work. Other factors that are related to the specific workplace are a factor of course but they are details not possible to glean from industry-wide trends. For instance, while payment is important to me, and a software engineer apparently makes about 13,000p/a more than a Software Developer, the average salary on offer is already significantly more than my previous job, so I’ll still be satisfied with that. I was also already planning to devote my studies to the top 5 in demand languages (Such as Java, Python) and eco-systems as I am concerned with job security, I don’t want to over-specialize myself into a career-trap. I also feel that my strong communication skills and personality would lead me into a “bridge between worlds” role where I take a managerial role over other programmers, and interface with non-technical staff within the company. </p>
