  <P>In my opinion, the GitHub activity log offers a skewed perspective on the contributions of members. Somebody who is doing minor edits, and then pushes immediately in order to avoid merge conflicts will have a very high number of commits, while somebody who is working on their own on a web-page can have fewer commits as they will only need to push updates when they need to check their work with other members of the team. Furthermore, if only one person oversees the file control, it means that person will gain authorship of all files unless they are fastidious about writing in shared author details, which is somewhat tedious. The lines of code submitted should be somewhat accurate, however. </P>
