  <h2>Individual Reflections</h2>
  <h3>Richard's Perception</h3>
    <p>In my view, the group worked very well together. Team members compelted tasks quickly and didn't shirk responsibility. What could have been improved however was my direction. In hindsight, I should have made much more granular divisions of tasks, prepared a "tasks list" for each team-memeber and then had an individual meeting with them to discuss the list, ensure comprehension of goals, and clarify my intentions for the final result's form. Also, by doing this further formalization of the work process, keeping track of memeber progress would have been much faster, and in the situation where a teamate was availible for work, I could have shifted a task over to them much more clearly.</p>
    <p>Having worked in university-level group projects, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of work provided by my teammates, and the speed of which they would respond. Something that I learned about working in a group in this project was the importance of filling the "small unit leadership" position. From speaking with people in other groups, they have noted issues with the group having a lack of iniative, direction and vision, which is not the case for us here. I also noted that in meetings I was the driving personality (which is fine), and if I was to "step back" from the focus, others would be unwilling to take the limelight. To be fair, I am older than them by about a decade, so the greater life experienc that I have makes me more confident.</p>
    <p>The GitHuB activities log was a fair reflection of the group's work, as we ported our content onto the platform early on and performed later updates via GitHub.</p>

  <h3>Jai's Perception</h3>
    <p> I believe our team worked exceptionally well together. This has by far been the best experience I've had working in a team. In the past when working in a team any larger than 3 people, there was always somebody not doing their assigned work and forcing others to pick up the slack. Sure sometimes team members struggled with certain tasks but they always tried. That was very refreshing. Our team seemed to pretty naturally mesh and work well together, and there were no disputes. I could do with improving my planing skills - I left some of my work a bit late and found myself rushing in the last few days. As a group we should work on keeping a consistent style with our HTML. This is not just limited to CSS, but also stuff like heading sizes and other stylistic and structural parts. </p>

  <h3>Tim's Perception</h3>
    <p>As a part of a team, I found that when there is a good team leader, everything becomes very simple, everything is orderly, and can be handed over to GitHub on time. Everyone can see other people's parts and make changes. This is what a group needs to do and it is responsible for everyone. I think our project will do better if we can hand in the task earlier and finish it rather than submit the job at the last time. I was very surprised at our team leader. I didn't expect that a good team leader could bring us so much convenience. It turns out that a good team leader plays a very important role in a group. Without Richard, we would have been scattered. In this project, I learned how to arrange my time reasonably. Because other subjects also have tasks, I have to complete all things in a limited time. Time management is very important. Reasonable distribution of rest and study time is the most valuable thing I learned this time. I am very lucky to be a member of the group, and I have learned a lot of useful and valuable knowledge on the way to cooperate with the group.</p>

  <h3>Wen's Perception</h3>
    <p>We have made a corresponding contribution to this assignment. The good thing we do is to distribute the tasks reasonably so that everyone can have enough opportunities to complete the task. It would be good if we could've started a bit earlier, which would have given us more time to finish everything off nicely and more time to plan all the parts of the assignment. The most surprising thing to me is how well our group went when we did the assignment as we respect each other's work, provide the solution for group members and everyone put a lot of effort into the assignment. Furthermore, we became more familiar with using GitHub and we also pushed as much as our works into gitHub.</p>

  <h3>Guanhong's Perception</h3>
    <p>I think we worked very well together on this assignment, and everyone did their part very well, although sometimes it was difficult for us to agree on web design. We did a great job of communicating, we were very clear about our tasks, and GitHub made it easier for us to keep track of everyone's progress. But if we had done the HTML part earlier we would have had more time to talk about the CSS part. I was very surprised by Richard's leadership. He was an excellent leader and he organized us well. I have never used GitHub before, but in this assignment my teammates have taught me how to use it, which has benefited me a lot</p>

  <h2>Group Reflection</h2>
    <p>From reading the collected reflections of individual team members, we can observe a few common themes the importance of leadership, pleasant surprise, the desire to have started earlier and technical standards.</p>

    <p>All reflections touched on the point of leadership and teamwork, expressing their gratitude that this group was managed effectively and fairly having expected the worst, as it is a university group project which have somewhat of a reputation! Everyone enjoyed that there was defined roles, tasks and expectations placed on everyone and that things were not done on an ad-hoc manner.</p>

    <p>Another common sentiment was the wish that we had started earlier than we did. This is very understandable as we started late, and worked down to the wire, but is perhaps unavoidable as motivation is often linked to pressure and until the pressure raises to a certain level, it is common for tasks to be left for later in favour of more immediate concerns. Week eight was "crunch week" for a few subjects, which had an effect.</p>

    <p>Everyone experienced issues with coming to grips with the new systems that we were making use of. GitHub was totally new to all members and we had to learn its functionality as we went along. The same went for AWS, which was found to have very poor design for allowing collaboration, and in the end it was decided with our tutor, Russel, that the AWS portion of the assignment should be conducted by a single member of the team.</p>

    <p>Something that was also touched upon in a few reflections was the lack of technical definitions. There were large inconsistencies in the submitted HTML code between members of the group, which contributed to the workload of the person integrating the content later. It would have been better to create an example webpage that showed how the code should be written, what style of indentation should be used, and other stylistic elements such as the location of return links. </p>

    <p>A better method of conducting the content writing might have been to create a google document for writing the content of the website and leave it to one teammate to convert this later to HTML. Unfortunately, we became somewhat overly focused on the use of GitHUb, as it was mandated by the assignment. "Target fixation" is never a good thing.</p>

    <p>Lastly, it is gratifying to see that no reflections contained sour notes with regards to social interaction with other teammates. This means that everyone worked diligently, treated each other with respect and took criticism in good grace. Well done team!</p>
