    <h2>What does cybersecurity do?</h2>

    <p>Cybersecurity is the protection of Internet-connected systems, such as hardware, software, and data, from cyber threats. Individuals and businesses use this practice to prevent unauthorized access to data centers and other computer systems.
    The goal of implementing network security is to provide a good security state for computers, servers, networks, mobile devices, and data stored by malicious attackers from these devices. Cyber-attacks can be designed to access, delete or extort sensitive data from organizations or users; for example, making network security critical. For example, medical, government, business, and financial organizations may all have important personal information about individuals.</p>

    <p>As the development of technology opens up new ways for cyber-attacks, cybersecurity is a constantly changing field. In addition, although major security vulnerabilities are often publicly pointed out, small organizations must still pay attention to security vulnerabilities because they can often become targets for viruses and phishing.</p>

    <p>In order to protect organizations, employees and individuals, organizations and services should implement cybersecurity tools, training, risk management methods, and constantly update the system as technology changes and developments</p>

    <h3>Types of cybersecurity threats</h3>

    <p>'keeping up with new technologies, security trends and threat intelligence is a difficult task. However, it is necessary to protect information and other assets from various forms of cyber threats'(Hugh Taylor2020,para.4). Cyber threats can include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Malware, any file or program can be used to harm computer users, such as worms, computer viruses, Trojan horses, and spyware.</li>

        <li>Ransomware attack is a type of malware that involves an attacker (usually through encryption) locking the victim's computer system file and asking for payment to decrypt and unlock it.</li>

        <li>Social engineering is an attack that relies on human-to-human interactions to induce users to disrupt security procedures in order to obtain sensitive information that is usually protected.</li>

        <li>Phishing is a form of fraud in which fraudulent emails are sent similar to emails from well-known sources; however, the purpose of these emails is to steal sensitive data, such as credit cards or login information.</li>
    </ul>


<h3>Cybersecurity challenges</h3>

<p>Cybersecurity is constantly challenged by hackers, data loss, privacy, risk management and changing cybersecurity strategies. There is currently no indication that cyber-attacks will decrease. In addition, as more entry points for attacks, more network security is needed to protect the network and equipment.</p>

<p>One of the most problematic elements of network security is the continuous development of security risks. With the emergence of new technologies and the use of technologies in new or different ways, new attack vectors have also been developed. Keeping up with these constantly changing and evolving attacks may pose challenges to the organization, and it also needs to update its practices to prevent attacks. This also includes ensuring that all elements of network security are constantly changed and updated to prevent potential vulnerabilities. This is particularly challenging for small organizations.</p>

<p>In addition, today, organizations can collect potential data from many individuals involved in one of these services. As more data is collected, the possibility that cyber criminals want to steal personally identifiable information is another issue. For example, an organization that stores personally identifiable information in the cloud may be subject to ransomware attacks and should do all it can to prevent cloud destruction.</p>

<p>Cybersecurity should also solve the education problems of end users, because employees may accidentally bring viruses into the workplace on their work computers, laptops or smartphones.
Another major challenge in cybersecurity includes job shortages. As the growth of data from the enterprise becomes more and more important, the need for more network security personnel to conduct incident analysis, management and response is also increasing. According to Margaret Rouse(2020), it is estimated that there are 2 million unfilled cybersecurity jobs worldwide. Cybersecurity venture capital companies also estimate that by 2021, there will be as many as 3.5 million unfilled cybersecurity jobs.</p>

<p>However, new advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) have begun to develop to help organize and manage data. Although it did not achieve the desired effect.</p>




<h2>What are the possible impacts if we don't pay attention to cybersecurity?</h2>

    <p>Most people in modern society encounter computing and communication technologies every day. Offices, shops, factories, street vendors and taxis are full of computers, even if they are not visible in public. People type on keyboards on computers or tablets every day and use their smartphones. People's personal lives involve computing through social networks, household management, communication with family and friends, and the management of personal affairs</p>

    <p>A great deal of information technology (IT) helps companies, organizations and governments in their daily operations. Companies of all sizes rely on computers to perform business processes from payroll and accounting to tracking inventory and sales to support research and development. The distribution of food and energy at each stage, from producers to retail consumers, depends on computers and networks. Almost everyone (in everyday society, business, government, and the military) relies on wireless and wired digital communications systems. IT is used to execute major business processes in government and many of the largest sectors of the economy, including financial services, healthcare, utilities, transportation, and retail and management services</p>

    <p>Bordoni(2018) claims that data breaches are one of the most pervasive and serious personal threats to cybersecurity and can wreak havoc on individuals or businesses. All businesses have a range of data, from customer insights to employee data, which often contain sensitive information that can easily be put at risk if the company does not take many safeguards. A lack of concern about cybersecurity can seriously hurt businesses. Such attacks cause direct financial losses to businesses, such as theft of company information, disruption of transactions and even the need to repair affected systems, all of which result in financial losses. In addition to the physical impact, network security vulnerabilities can also cause reputational damage. Lacking confidence in the safety of the affected businesses, customers will be more inclined to take risks elsewhere, resulting in lost sales and profits.</p>

<h2>How cyber-attacks will affect us and how to protect ourselves?</h2>

    <p>Cybercrime has drawn a lot of attention, with massive data breaches at large companies and computer systems at government agencies being shut down for extortion. But cybercrime is not just a major problem for large corporations and national governments. Cybercriminals can go after large companies and organizations without mercy. While chief executives can afford dedicated cybersecurity teams, when it comes to securing computers and devices, the average person is one person. This leaves millions of potential targets vulnerable to cyber attacks, ranging from data theft and ransomware used to organize to more personal attacks designed to cause confusion and confusion.</p>

    <p>Many people are unaware of the risks of cyber attacks. A recent report by NORTON shows how vulnerable many people are not aware of it. It is reported that 44% of people surveyed thought they were "worthy indicators" of hackers. Despite these assumptions, nearly 86 percent of respondents believed they had suffered a phishing attack. In addition to legitimate emails, about 40% of respondents were unable to specifically name phishing emails (Norton 2016).</p>

    <p>Attacks on mobile devices have also been on the rise, mainly in the form of trojans. Cybercriminals often disguise the malware by selling it on the official app store and seamlessly melding it with legitimate applications. Other common vulnerabilities include unpatched software and social media, where the interactive nature of social media sites makes it easier for malware to spread.</p>

    <p>For individuals, best practices are simple. The good news is that in most cases, some fairly large security organizations, such as Verizon's or AT&T's SecOps teams, are between consumers and hackers. You should still take precautions to ensure your information is safe:</p>
<ul>

     <li>Password hygiene. Big security organizations cannot protect consumers against phishing or hackers who can guess passwords like "1234." Common sense and password hygiene can go a long way to protect consumers from cyber threats.</li>

     <li>Anti-virus software. Subscribe to antivirus software and keep your system up to date with automated scheduled scans.</li>

     <li>Caution against phishing attacks. Be careful about opening file attachments. Phishing and spear phishing emails ones that look real but are not. if you pay attention. For instance, if you get an email that says "overdue invoice" with a PDF attachment, do not open it unless you are 100 percent sure you know who sent it.</li>
