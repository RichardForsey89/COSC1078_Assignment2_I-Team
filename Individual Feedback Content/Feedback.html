  <h2>Individual Feedback</h2>
  <h3>Richard's Feedback</h3>
  <p><strong>Jai</strong><br>
    I found Jai to be a very reliable teammate, and If I were to assign tasks to him  I could be confident that they would be done to a high standard, In addition Jai was able to conduct independent work and required minimal guidance from myself with regard to the requirements or the desired end-state of the work. It would have been better if his circumstances allowed the use of a microphone in our meetings, as it would have allowed for better rapport, but I am understanding of how this was not possible. To a degree I feel like I underutilized Jai’s talents out of concern of giving too much work over to him. I would be more than happy to work with him again in future.</p>

  <p><strong>Wen</strong><br>
    Wen was a pleasure to work with in this project. I knew that she has already completed some courses on web design, so I felt confidence in handing the group profile task over to her. She was able to work diligently and complete her jobs with a minimum of direction from myself. When direction was given, she was attentive and implemented the new requirements fastidiously. She was also highly communicative and responsive to messages within the “work communication” thread on our MS Teams group. It was great to have Wen on our team.</p>

  <p><strong>Anthony</strong><br>
    Anthony was a very solid worker in our group. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the content he delivered for the IT technologies pages that he wrote. I had been expecting that I would need to do some revision passes, but it was not needed at all. After that, I moved Anthony around to contribute on other parts of the project. As the 2nd most “forceful” personality of the group, I should have made more use of him as an assistant leader within the group.</p>

  <p><strong>Timothy</strong><br>
    At the start of our assignment, I conducted a review of the 1st assignment pages of my teammates and concluded that Timothy would require the most direction from myself. This is okay, as not everyone is used to this style of work yet, especially in the first semester of the first year of university. With that in mind, I gave him tasks that I had a pre-existing familiarity with, so I could assist him more easily. After his primary tasks were completed, I set him as an assistant for other team members as needed. Having now become more familiar with him, I can see how I could better direct him and give more room for him to be productive in.</p>


  <h3>Jai's Feedback</h3>
    <p><strong>Richard</strong><br>
      Richard was in charge of the tools for our project including GitHub, AWS and team planing. He was also our team leader and the main port of call for any questions we might have had. He was also allocated the task of interviewing an IT professional as he already had contacts in the industry. Richard performed well beyond my expectations - he was always on the ball, had important infrastructure prepared well in advance and his work was done to a very good standard. Richard always volunteered to proof-read and check over our work and he organised our team meetings and managed our MS Teams. At the start of our project I was assigned to record and manage the recording of our Teams meetings, but as I missed a meeting owing to my poor internet Richard seamlessly assumed responsibility for the recordings and that flexibility was very important for our team. As our leader, Richard was the glue that held our team together, as a good leader should be. I would be very pleased to work with him again.</p>

    <p><strong>Timothy</strong><br>
      Timothy was assigned to Industry Data with Wen and myself, but primarily as a backup contributor, he would only be required if Wen or I was struggling and he proved unnecessary He was also assigned to Project Idea. Timothy at first had struggles with github and was publishing his task somewhere else so perhaps his git commit history isn't the most accurate, however once this issue was corrected, he appears to have completed his portion to a good standard. Timothy just needs to brush up on his Git skills and he would be a model team mate, though I did not have much interaction with him in this project so I cannot say too much about him. I would like a chance to work more closely with Timothy in the future.</p>

    <p><strong>Anthony</strong><br>
      Guanhong was assigned to IT Technologies with me, we each did two of the four write-ups. I would've liked if Guanhong uploaded his work to github more regularly so I could use it as a reference for my own part of the task and see if I was going about it the same way. When I did see his work however, I was quite pleased. He had written quite comprehensively on his subjects of cyber security and internet of things (IoT). I found Guanhong made good use of his HTML skills with appropriate use of headings, paragraphs and unordered lists. Despite his failings, I would work with him again.</p>

    <p><strong>Wen</strong><br>
      Wen was assigned to Industry Data with Timothy and myself as well as Team Profile. Wen was a very good communicator and had no trouble telling me what she'd like me to look at or asking if she needed help. Wen's team profile page was quite impressive and she managed to seamlessly merge all group members and her analysis of our ideal jobs showed some good insight into how our jobs compared and contrasted. Working more closely with Wen than my other team mates, I found her to be a very good partner and would gladly work with her in the future.</p>

  <h3>Wen's Feedback</h3>
      <p><strong>Richard</strong><br>
        I feel very grateful to have you as my leader. You were so patient with me. I greatly appreciated that when checking the progress you took the time to break things down to a level that I could understand and then build upon. Your thoughtfulness and generosity empower me and encourage me to do my best. One thing I learned from you is that there is always scope for improvement! You have an amazing ability to bring out the best in all of us.</p>

        <p><strong>Anthony</strong><br>
          Anthony has infected us with a positive attitude he bringing to Team every day, makes assignment become easier to implement! I appreciate his relentless efforts and impressed with the work produced by him!</p>

        <p><strong>Jai</strong><br>
          Jai is our problem-solver. Your excellent analytical skills, and your quick responses,  turn problems into a positive effect. Thank you for listening to others’ ideas with concern and an open mind creates an environment of mutual respect where relationships flourish. I have enjoyed working with you so much.</p>

        <p><strong>Timothy</strong><br>
          Thank you for giving me a helping hand on industry data as I was struggling to keep up with the workload.  Without your help, I might have had to delay this assignment. The extra effort you put into this really made a big difference not only for me but the team also. I'm grateful for your dedication and hard work.</p>

    <h3>Tim's Feedback</h3>
      <p><strong>Richard</strong><br>
        Richard is the leader of our group. He has led us to complete most of the tasks. He is very careful and serious. I respect Richard very much. He is the most team leader who has done everything he can and spent a lot of time on our team members. I also learned a lot from his advice.</p>

      <p><strong>Wen</strong><br>
        Wen and I completed part of the industry data together. I gave her a lot of suggestions and she was very happy to help me. Sometimes I forget the meeting time and Wen reminds me that I will not miss any important information. Her design idea is also first-class. She is a very dedicated person in our group.</p>

      <p><strong>Jai</strong><br>
        Jai is an introverted team member. He often doesn't speak in group meetings, but as a part of the team, he can finish his tasks on time every time. He is a very amazing man.</p>

      <p><strong>Anthony</strong><br>
        Anthony is a very hard-working team member. He arrived on time in every meeting. He is also very positive about the group tasks. He can finish every task at a high level and on time. Treat the team members very carefully, remind us what is unfinished and help us to finish the task.</p>

    <h3>Anthony's Feedback</h3>
      <p><strong>Richard</strong><br>
        Richard is a great leader. Under his leadership, we are progressing smoothly, and he will check everyone's task completion and give his own opinions. These opinions are very useful, and they have made me learn a lot. As a leader, he couldn't do any better. He organized everything, assigned tasks, set up AWS and GitHub. Richard has undertaken most of the tedious tasks, which makes me only need to focus on my part</p>

      <p><strong>Jai</strong><br>
        My teammate Jai is a very quiet person, in fact I have not heard him speak (because his computer does not have a microphone). But this does not affect our communication, he can give timely feedback and give opinions through typing every time. he works very hard, he has undertaken two parts in this operation, IT technologies and idustry data. It ’s not easy, Both require extensive reading and analysis</p>

      <p><strong>Wen</strong><br>
        Wen is an excellent teammate and she is responsible for Industry data and Team profile. She does everything well, and he's a great communicator. She was like a bridge between each of us. She would ask me what I thought or opinion about team profile, so that she could make a perfect profile. When I wanted to make some changes in my personal introduction in the team profile, Wen accepted my idea and helped me modify my self-introduction. Finally, I was very satisfied with our team profile</p>

      <p><strong>Timothy</strong><br>
        My teammate Timothy is a hard worker. He was in charge of the Project ideas section, and he volunteered to help others after completing his tasks. I have to say that I admire him very much. Even if he couldn't attend the group meeting because of class conflict, he would ask about the topic and content of the meeting after class to find out what he needed to do. He is a good teammate and I appreciate his contribution</p>
