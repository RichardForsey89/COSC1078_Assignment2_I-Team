<h1>Feedback From Guanhong Chen</h1>

<h2>Richard Forsey</h2>
<p>Richard is a great leader. Under his leadership, we are progressing smoothly, and he will check everyone's task completion and give his own opinions. These opinions are very useful, and they have made me learn a lot. As a leader, he couldn't do any better. He organized everything, assigned tasks, set up AWS and GitHub. Richard has undertaken most of the tedious tasks, which makes me only need to focus on my part</p> 

<h2>Jai Wells</h2>
<p>My teammate Jai is a very quiet person, in fact I have not heard him speak (because his computer does not have a microphone). But this does not affect our communication, he can give timely feedback and give opinions through typing every time. he works very hard, he has undertaken two parts in this operation, IT technologies and idustry data. It â€™s not easy, Both require extensive reading and analysis</p> 

<h2>Wen Guo</h2>
<p>My teammate Wen is a cute girl. And we are very lucky to have a girl in our group. Because we had no idea about design, Wen was punctual for every meeting, even when she was just getting up. She is responsible for the part of team profile, and she will take the initiative to contact each person to discuss their ideal job and self-introduction. And she also accepted part of the Industry data. As I said, she is a lively and lovely girl, and she is the only girl in our tutorial class</p> 

<h2>Timothy Pan</h2>
<p>My teammate Timothy is a hard worker. He was in charge of the Project ideas section, and he volunteered to help others after completing his tasks. I have to say that I admire him very much. Even if he couldn't attend the group meeting because of class conflict, he would ask about the topic and content of the meeting after class to find out what he needed to do. He is a good teammate and I appreciate his contribution</p>
