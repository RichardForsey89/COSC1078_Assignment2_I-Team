<h1>Feedback From Guanhong Chen</h1>

<h2>Richard Forsey</h2>
<p>Richard is a great leader. Under his leadership, we are progressing smoothly, and he will check everyone's task completion and give his own opinions. These opinions are very useful, and they have made me learn a lot. As a leader, he couldn't do any better. He organized everything, assigned tasks, set up AWS and GitHub. Richard has undertaken most of the tedious tasks, which makes me only need to focus on my part</p> 

<h2>Jai Wells</h2>
<p>My teammate Jai is a very quiet person, in fact I have not heard him speak (because his computer does not have a microphone). But this does not affect our communication, he can give timely feedback and give opinions through typing every time. he works very hard, he has undertaken two parts in this operation, IT technologies and idustry data. It â€™s not easy, Both require extensive reading and analysis</p> 

<h2>Wen Guo</h2>
<p>Wen is an excellent teammate and she is responsible for Industry data and Team profile. She does everything well, and he's a great communicator. She was like a bridge between each of us. She would ask me what I thought or opinion about team profile, so that she could make a perfect profile. When I wanted to make some changes in my personal introduction in the team profile, Wen accepted my idea and helped me modify my self-introduction. Finally, I was very satisfied with our team profile</p>

<h2>Timothy Pan</h2>
<p>My teammate Timothy is a hard worker. He was in charge of the Project ideas section, and he volunteered to help others after completing his tasks. I have to say that I admire him very much. Even if he couldn't attend the group meeting because of class conflict, he would ask about the topic and content of the meeting after class to find out what he needed to do. He is a good teammate and I appreciate his contribution</p>
