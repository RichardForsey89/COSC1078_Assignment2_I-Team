        <h1>Jai's Feedback</h1>
        <p>
            <h2>Richard</h2>
            Richard was in charge of the tools for our project including GitHub, AWS and team planing. He was also our team leader and the main port of call for any questions we might have had. 
            He was also allocated the task of interviewing an IT professional as he already had contacts in the industry. Richard performed well beyond my expectations - he was always 
            on the ball, had important infrastructure prepared well in advance and his work was done to a very good standard. Richard always volunteered to proof-read and check over 
            our work and he organised our team meetings and managed our MS Teams. At the start of our project I was assigned to record and manage the recording of our Teams meetings, 
            but as I missed a meeting owing to my poor internet Richard seamlessly assumed responsibility for the recordings and that flexibility was very important for our team. 
            As our leader, Richard was the glue that held our team together, as a good leader should be. I would be very pleased to work with him again

            <h2>Timothy</h2>
            Timothy was assigned to Industry Data with Wen and myself, but primarily as a backup contributor, he would only be required if Wen or I was struggling and he proved unnecessary 
            He was also assigned to Project Idea. Timothy at first had struggles with github and was publishing his task somewhere else so perhaps his git commit history isn't
            the most accurate, however once this issue was corrected, he appears to have completed his portion to a good standard. Timothy just needs to brush up on his Git skills
            and he would be a model team mate, though I did not have much interaction with him in this project so I cannot say too much about him. I would like a chance to 
            work more closely with Timothy in the future

            <h2>Guanhong</h2>
            Guanhong was assigned to IT Technologies with me, we each did two of the four write-ups. I would've liked if Guanhong uploaded his work to github more regularly so 
            I could use it as a reference for my own part of the task and see if I was going about it the same way. When I did see his work however, I was quite pleased. He had 
            written quite comprehensively on his subjects of cyber security and internet of things (IoT). I found Guanhong made good use of his HTML skills with appropriate use 
            of headings, paragraphs and unordered lists. Despite his failings, I would work with him again

            <h2>Wen</h2>
            Wen was assigned to Industry Data with Timothy and myself as well as Team Profile. Wen was a very good communicator and had no trouble telling me what she'd like me 
            to look at or asking if she needed help. Wen's team profile page was quite impressive and she managed to seamlessly merge all group members and her analysis of 
            our ideal jobs showed some good insight into how our jobs compared and contrasted. Working more closely with Wen than my other team mates, I found her to be a very good 
            partner and would gladly work with her in the future.
