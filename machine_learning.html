    <h1>Machine Learning</h1>
    <hr>
    <h2>What does it do?</h2>
    <p>
        Machine Learning (ML) is a type of computer algorithm that naturally improves from experience. ML makes choices
        based on training data presented to it and past scenarios it ran. Example of ML in use today are: Deepmind's <a
            href="https://deepmind.com/research/case-studies/alphago-the-story-so-far">AlphaGo</a> and <a
            href="https://www.uber.com/au/en/atg/technology/">Uber's</a> and <a
            href="https://waymo.com/tech/">Waymo's</a> self driving cars. Alpha Go is an ML system for playing the
        ancient Chinese game Go (considered one of the most complex and challenging games in history) and beat the
        reigning
        European champion of Go in 2015, Fan Hui. That was AlphaGo's first ever game against a Go professional! AlphaGo
        has now "arguably [become] the greatest Go player of all time"<sup>[1]</sup> all thanks to machine learning.
        Self driving cars use ML to learn from past mistakes, helps them to understand how another driver will react,
        and allows them to comprehend situations they haven't seen before, based on past information. In future, ML like
        what was used for AlphaGo could be used to enhance computer controlled opponents in other board and video games
        and create an experience indistinguishable from playing with a human. ML can enable 'no-code environments' -
        Tony Fader, ML/NLP Software Developer at AppSheet says that now "... you only need to download a few packages
        and follow an online course ..."<sup>[2]</sup> to get started with ML in your program. The rapid advancements of
        neural networks, a set of algorithms designed to mimic the human brain and it's decision making process, are the
        key to improving ML. Neural networks allow more accurate, human likely decision making which is the ultimate
        goal of ML and artificial intelligence in general. Also helping is the ever improving computing power available
        to us, though this growth has been slowing down in recent years.

    <h2>What is the likely impact?</h2>
    <p>
        ML like used by AlphaGo could be used by e-sports professionals, for example, to train without needing to find a
        full team of equally skilled people to train against. Staying with sports, using ML to develop strategies and
        deciding on
        complementary team compositions could eliminate coaches from sports teams in favour of ML aided algorithms. ML
        also has the potential to drastically reduce the scope and number of jobs in software development, Tony Fader's
        idea of a no-code environment, in his own words, leads to "... enabling anyone (not just programmers) to use
        no-code machine learning in their own bespoke apps."<sup>[2]</sup> and eventually this could lead to ML
        designing the entire app based on the design specifications and making the only necessary software developers
        ones who work on ML and neural networks. On a more positive note, advances in consumer application of ML means
        thing once thought futuristic and the realm of science fiction like self driving cars and truly intelligent
        artificial assistants (far beyond the likes of Siri, Google Assistant and Alexa) are much closer then we used to
        think and will soon be available to everyone, increasing our easy access to information and potentially allowing
        us more free time as we won't have to spend upwards of an hour driving car every day, instead using that time
        for more productive matters such as work or for entertainment such as reading or watching a movie.

    <h2>How does it affect you?</h2>
    <p>
        As an aspiring software developer, the notion of no-code environments is a little scary to me, though I do not
        expect this drastic of a change to happen overnight, it'll hopefully be a gradual change (yet how often are tech
        trend predictions accurate?). I do not have a drivers license, therefore ML powered self driving cars will allow
        me to reap the advantages of driving a car, without the need to earn my license as presumably, once the
        technology is perfected, a license won't be required. My friends and family will likely be affected just the
        same as most people. Nobody I know would be particularly affected by ML, outside of the basics at least. Most
        people I know will adopt self driving cars eventually, better AI assistants probably won't make most people use
        them more than they already do, I believe most of the consumer facing benefits of ML will go largely unnoticed.
