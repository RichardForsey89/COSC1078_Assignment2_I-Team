        <h1>IT Work Interview</h1>
        <hr>
        <h2>An interview with Cindy Adelia, an IT professional of 8 years.</h2>
        <p>
[19:09, 01/05/2020] Richard: What is your current position at your company?
[19:09, 01/05/2020] Cindy: Business Intelligence Developer
[19:10, 01/05/2020] Richard: How long have you had that role?
[19:11, 01/05/2020] Cindy: 3-4 years. In the same company for 8 years so far, previously as software developer
[19:12, 01/05/2020] Richard: Okay, how about we split() the interview by those two roles, looking at the current role first?
[19:12, 01/05/2020] Cindy: Sure yep
[19:13, 01/05/2020] Richard: What kind of work do you do on a day to day basis at your company? Is it limited to your official role?
[19:16, 01/05/2020] Cindy: Nope, not limited to official role at all. Work day to day is probably about 50% of the technical, official job. Lots of support, random ICT staff legwork, etc
[19:17, 01/05/2020] Richard: So what do you do for the technical, official job?
[19:17, 01/05/2020] Cindy: Reporting, data integration, database administration, data warehousing
[19:18, 01/05/2020] Richard: And with this part of the  job, what kinds of people do you interact with? Are they other IT professionals? Clients? Investors? The general public?
[19:20, 01/05/2020] Cindy: Other divisions within my company, so not really clients but the dynamic is quite similar. And IT professionals. 50-50 I'd say
[19:24, 01/05/2020] Richard: Ah, so for 50% the time you are speaking with management, HR, etc?
[19:25, 01/05/2020] Cindy: Hmmm maybe like 10% management, 10% corporate HR stuff, 30% collaboration with other ICT people
[19:26, 01/05/2020] Cindy: Wait hang on, I think I understand you now
[19:28, 01/05/2020] Cindy: So this is the 50% that's other division, right? My reporting stuff, mostly they are for other division, like operational business. E.g. budget report, client appointment attendance report, etc
[19:29, 01/05/2020] Cindy: And say for data integration, e.g HR has a new onboarding system, and they want it to be integrated with the induction system
[19:29, 01/05/2020] Cindy: So whoever needs the service
[19:30, 01/05/2020] Richard: Ah i see.
[19:31, 01/05/2020] Richard: How about the non-official role work that you do?
[19:35, 01/05/2020] Cindy: Hmmm so for me, since I've been here for a while, people know me. And sometimes people just contact me directly instead of submitting IT ticket, for example. And if I can help, even though it's not my role, sometimes it's easier for me to just do it
[19:37, 01/05/2020] Cindy: Sometimes some teams are under the pump. E.g. if we know we're expecting 100 calls to Helpdesk line tomorrow morning, I can be called to help out. Or offered, if I feel nice that day üòù
[19:38, 01/05/2020] Richard: I'm sure everyone eventually collects this kind of extra work at a job :)
[19:38, 01/05/2020] Cindy: Yeah spot on haha
[19:38, 01/05/2020] Richard: Where do you spend most of your time when you are at work?
[19:39, 01/05/2020] Cindy: My desk. Otherwise, meetings
[19:40, 01/05/2020] Richard: Are meetings painful as per the stereotype, or worthwhile?
[19:42, 01/05/2020] Cindy: It can be. Meeting is always better when there's an agenda, and there's an expectation for everyone
[19:43, 01/05/2020] Cindy: Do you want some red flags about meetings? üòÜ
[19:43, 01/05/2020] Richard: Sure, let's hear them!
[19:45, 01/05/2020] Cindy: If you have more than 5 people
If you havent heard about the topic before
If you dont know why you're invited
If you DO know that the meeting runner sucks
[19:46, 01/05/2020] Richard: Tips I'll have to keep in mind üòÑ
[19:46, 01/05/2020] Cindy: Lol dont worry about that topic, you'll learn quick
[19:48, 01/05/2020] Richard: What aspect of your position is the most challenging?
[19:49, 01/05/2020] Cindy: It's a relatively new field, and a fast moving one
[19:49, 01/05/2020] Cindy: Lots to learn, lots of opinions/school of thoughts
[19:53, 01/05/2020] Richard: Could you give some examples? :)
[19:57, 01/05/2020] Cindy: Hmmm this is subjective, but I do feel that the Business Intelligence field is not really a thing when I was still studying (so 8 years ago?)
[19:57, 01/05/2020] Richard: So what is Business Inteligence?
[19:58, 01/05/2020] Cindy: Lol i feel like this is a trap question
[20:01, 01/05/2020] Cindy: Instead of going to google, I'm gonna give you something from my head. So traditionally you have databases, and you have people who can access databases and write SQL queries (IT). So users call IT to build reports
[20:03, 01/05/2020] Cindy: Business Intelligence solution should enable non IT, non SQL literate people to access the data and build reports, via data models. Like more drag and drop stuff
[20:05, 01/05/2020] Cindy: BI reports are also more dynamic, and enables users to do more insights reports/playing around with scenarions
[20:06, 01/05/2020] Richard: Hey that's a good definition of that, well done!
[20:06, 01/05/2020] Cindy: Lol phew
[20:07, 01/05/2020] Richard: How about your Software developer days?
[20:08, 01/05/2020] Cindy: Hmmm we just build lots of webapps to digitize some of the business. E.g. building form machine to replace paper documents
[20:09, 01/05/2020] Cindy: Or what about the Software Developer days that you're after specifically?
[20:10, 01/05/2020] Richard: Hmm, what languages did you use and how did you apply them in an example project? Did you find what you learned at uni to be mostly sufficient, or did you need to do a lot of learning on the job?
[20:13, 01/05/2020] Cindy: Back in Deakin I knew HTML, CSS, Javascript, Visual Basic, C#. All in use at work

Also knew Oracle SQL, Java (Android), which didnt get used

At work, had to learn Microsoft SQL. So all in all, not to bad really üòÜ
[20:18, 01/05/2020] Cindy: I did have to learn a fair bit in my job, just general how the business work etc. And was quite lucky I had a mentor that guided my along the way
[20:18, 01/05/2020] Cindy: Like at work, there was a senior dev that's babysitting me haha
[20:18, 01/05/2020] Richard: Was the mentor an official thing, or just happenstance?
[20:19, 01/05/2020] Cindy: Happenstance, although I was a 20yo, straight out of uni. No way anyone was gonna give me passwords to IT systems and not supervise me
[20:21, 01/05/2020] Richard: Heh
[20:21, 01/05/2020] Richard: What was the most challenging part of being a software devloper?
[20:23, 01/05/2020] Cindy: Serious answer, understanding what the users need, and designing a solution accordingly
[20:25, 01/05/2020] Richard: I can already see how that can be the case.
[20:25, 01/05/2020] Richard: Was the set of people you interested with any different?
[20:26, 01/05/2020] Cindy: Hmmm not sure if I understand the question?
[20:27, 01/05/2020] Richard: What kinds of people did you interact with? Are they other IT professionals? Clients? Investors? The general public?
[20:27, 01/05/2020] Cindy: Oooh. Nah pretty much the same
[20:28, 01/05/2020] Cindy: The softwares were also for internal consumptions, so again dealing with other divisions
[20:32, 01/05/2020] Richard: I see
[20:33, 01/05/2020] Richard: What would be your advice to people starting their studies of IT, or their IT career?
[20:36, 01/05/2020] Cindy: Keep an open mind. Try lots of new stuff. I didnt know I was keen on SQL/data until I worked with it for a while
[20:38, 01/05/2020] Cindy: Try to listen well. The same tech/concept can be implemented a million different ways. Each set up is always a bit weird
[20:39, 01/05/2020] Richard: solid advice :)
[20:39, 01/05/2020] Richard: That should be all for now :)
[20:40, 01/05/2020] Cindy: Cool, good luck with the assignment man, hope that helped :)
[20:42, 01/05/2020] Richard: Helped a lot i think :)
