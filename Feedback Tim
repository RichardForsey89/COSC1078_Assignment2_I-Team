<h2>Richard</h2>
<p>Richard is the leader of our group. He has led us to complete most of the tasks. He is very careful and serious. I respect Richard very much. He is the most team leader who has done everything he can and spent a lot of time on our team members. I also learned a lot from his advice.</p>
<h2>Wen</h2>
<p>Wen and I completed part of the industry data together. I gave her a lot of suggestions and she was very happy to help me. Sometimes I forget the meeting time and Wen reminds me that I will not miss any important information. Her design idea is also first-class. As the only woman in our group, she really helped us a lot.</p>
<h2>Jai</h2>
<p>Jai is an introverted team member. He often doesn't speak in group meetings, but as a part of the team, he can finish his tasks on time every time. He is a very amazing man.</p>
<h2>Anthony</h2>
<p>Anthony is a very hard-working team member. He arrived on time in every meeting. He is also very positive about the group tasks. He can finish every task at a high level and on time. Treat the team members very carefully, remind us what is unfinished and help us to finish the task.</p>
