<h2>Cybersecurity</h2>
    <h3>What does cybersecurity do?</h3>
<body>
Cybersecurity is the protection of Internet-connected systems, such as hardware, software, and data, from cyber threats. Individuals and businesses use this practice to prevent unauthorized access to data centers and other computer systems.
The goal of implementing network security is to provide a good security state for computers, servers, networks, mobile devices, and data stored by malicious attackers from these devices. Cyber-attacks can be designed to access, delete or extort sensitive data from organizations or users; for example, making network security critical. For example, medical, government, business, and financial organizations may all have important personal information about individuals.
<br>
As the development of technology opens up new ways for cyber-attacks, cybersecurity is a constantly changing field. In addition, although major security vulnerabilities are often publicly pointed out, small organizations must still pay attention to security vulnerabilities because they can often become targets for viruses and phishing.
<br>
In order to protect organizations, employees and individuals, organizations and services should implement cybersecurity tools, training, risk management methods, and constantly update the system as technology changes and developments
<br><br>
 <p>Types of cybersecurity threats</p>
    
    'keeping up with new technologies, security trends and threat intelligence is a difficult task. However, it is necessary to protect information and other assets from various forms of cyber threats'(Hugh Taylor2020,para.4). Cyber threats can include:
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>Malware is a form of malware, any file or program can be used to harm computer users, such as worms, computer viruses, Trojan horses, and spyware.</li>

        <li>Ransomware attack is a type of malware that involves an attacker (usually through encryption) locking the victim's computer system file and asking for payment to decrypt and unlock it.</li>

        <li>Social engineering is an attack that relies on human-to-human interactions to induce users to disrupt security procedures in order to obtain sensitive information that is usually protected.</li>

        <li>Phishing is a form of fraud in which fraudulent emails are sent similar to emails from well-known sources; however, the purpose of these emails is to steal sensitive data, such as credit cards or login information.</li>
    </ul>
<br>
<p>Cybersecurity challenges</p>
    
Cybersecurity is constantly challenged by hackers, data loss, privacy, risk management and changing cybersecurity strategies. There is currently no indication that cyber-attacks will decrease. In addition, as more entry points for attacks, more network security is needed to protect the network and equipment.
<br>
One of the most problematic elements of network security is the continuous development of security risks. With the emergence of new technologies and the use of technologies in new or different ways, new attack vectors have also been developed. Keeping up with these constantly changing and evolving attacks may pose challenges to the organization, and it also needs to update its practices to prevent attacks. This also includes ensuring that all elements of network security are constantly changed and updated to prevent potential vulnerabilities. This is particularly challenging for small organizations.
<br>
In addition, today, organizations can collect potential data from many individuals involved in one of these services. As more data is collected, the possibility that cyber criminals want to steal personally identifiable information is another issue. For example, an organization that stores personally identifiable information in the cloud may be subject to ransomware attacks and should do all it can to prevent cloud destruction.
<br>
Cybersecurity should also solve the education problems of end users, because employees may accidentally bring viruses into the workplace on their work computers, laptops or smartphones.
Another major challenge in cybersecurity includes job shortages. As the growth of data from the enterprise becomes more and more important, the need for more network security personnel to conduct incident analysis, management and response is also increasing. According to Margaret Rouse(2020), it is estimated that there are 2 million unfilled cybersecurity jobs worldwide. Cybersecurity venture capital companies also estimate that by 2021, there will be as many as 3.5 million unfilled cybersecurity jobs.
<br>
However, new advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) have begun to develop to help organize and manage data. Although it did not achieve the desired effect.
</body>
<h3>What are the possible impacts if we don't pay attention to cybersecurity?</h3>
<body>Most people in modern society encounter computing and communication technologies every day. Offices, shops, factories, street vendors and taxis are full of computers, even if they are not visible in public. People type on keyboards on computers or tablets every day and use their smartphones. People's personal lives involve computing through social networks, household management, communication with family and friends, and the management of personal affairs
    <br>
A great deal of information technology (IT) helps companies, organizations and governments in their daily operations. Companies of all sizes rely on computers to perform business processes from payroll and accounting to tracking inventory and sales to support research and development. The distribution of food and energy at each stage, from producers to retail consumers, depends on computers and networks. Almost everyone (in everyday society, business, government, and the military) relies on wireless and wired digital communications systems. IT is used to execute major business processes in government and many of the largest sectors of the economy, including financial services, healthcare, utilities, transportation, and retail and management services
<br>
 Bordoni(2018) claims that data breaches are one of the most pervasive and serious personal threats to cybersecurity and can wreak havoc on individuals or businesses. All businesses have a range of data, from customer insights to employee data, which often contain sensitive information that can easily be put at risk if the company does not take many safeguards. A lack of concern about cybersecurity can seriously hurt businesses. Such attacks cause direct financial losses to businesses, such as theft of company information, disruption of transactions and even the need to repair affected systems, all of which result in financial losses. In addition to the physical impact, network security vulnerabilities can also cause reputational damage. Lacking confidence in the safety of the affected businesses, customers will be more inclined to take risks elsewhere, resulting in lost sales and profits.
</body>
<h3>How cyber-attacks will affect us and how to protect ourselves?</h3>
<body>Cybercrime has drawn a lot of attention, with massive data breaches at large companies and computer systems at government agencies being shut down for extortion. But cybercrime is not just a major problem for large corporations and national governments. Cybercriminals can go after large companies and organizations without mercy. While chief executives can afford dedicated cybersecurity teams, when it comes to securing computers and devices, the average person is one person. This leaves millions of potential targets vulnerable to cyber attacks, ranging from data theft and ransomware used to organize to more personal attacks designed to cause confusion and confusion.
<br>
Many people are unaware of the risks of cyber attacks. A recent report by NORTON shows how vulnerable many people are not aware of it. It is reported that 44% of people surveyed thought they were "worthy indicators" of hackers. Despite these assumptions, nearly 86 percent of respondents believed they had suffered a phishing attack. In addition to legitimate emails, about 40% of respondents were unable to specifically name phishing emails (Norton 2016).
<br>
Attacks on mobile devices have also been on the rise, mainly in the form of trojans. Cybercriminals often disguise the malware by selling it on the official app store and seamlessly melding it with legitimate applications. Other common vulnerabilities include unpatched software and social media, where the interactive nature of social media sites makes it easier for malware to spread.
<br>
For individuals, best practices are simple. The good news is that in most cases, some fairly large security organizations, such as Verizon's or AT&T's SecOps teams, are between consumers and hackers. You should still take precautions to ensure your information is safe:
<ul> 
<li>Password hygiene. Big security organizations cannot protect consumers against phishing or hackers who can guess passwords like "1234." Common sense and password hygiene can go a long way to protect consumers from cyber threats.</li>

<li>Anti-virus software. Subscribe to antivirus software and keep your system up to date with automated scheduled scans.</li>

 <li>Caution against phishing attacks. Be careful about opening file attachments. Phishing and spear phishing emails ones that look real but are not. if you pay attention. For instance, if you get an email that says "overdue invoice" with a PDF attachment, do not open it unless you are 100 percent sure you know who sent it.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Internet of Things (IoT)</h2>
<h3>What does IoT do?</h3>
<body>In short, the Internet of things is the concept of connecting any device (as long as it has an on/off switch) to the Internet and other connected devices. The Internet of things is a vast network of Internet of things and people, all of whom collect and share data about how they are used and their surroundings(Clark, J 2016).
<br>
Including the object of all shapes and sizes, from smart microwave oven (automatic cooking food) can be at the right time to self-driving cars (its complex sensors can detect the object from a path) to the measurable movement of wearable fitness equipment, including various shape and size of the object of your heart rate and the steps of the day, and then use that information to suggest exercise plan to you. There are even internet-connected footballs that track their throwing speed and speed and record these statistics through an app for future training.
<br>
In most cases, the public will connect today's Internet of Things with smart homes. The smart plug can turn off the lights as planned. Not only will the virtual doorbell ring, but it will also show you what you are doing. The voice assistant can keep your life in a normal state, and can also keep your useless trivia knowledge in the correct state. In addition to the joke, this is the last project that the Internet of Things has taken off. Now, the application has moved from occasional convenience to daily integration. More than just a virtual toggle switch, here are some examples from outside your home: now is the time for your next oil change. Instead of calling you, your vehicle will automatically set an appointment and seamlessly add it to the In your calendar. In addition to personal and daily professional significance, the larger practical applications are also more impressive. The positive impact of the Internet of Things on the transportation network is most obvious. As we all know, the US infrastructure is collapsing, but what if the sensors are placed in a bridge frame or layered in specific channels? Stress or failure on the surface or structure will be transmitted back to the centralized hub, and then appropriate repairs can be arranged(IQS Directory n.d.). The Internet of Things can even help increase efficiency or keep cities safe. Sensors can help determine water leaks in the city's pipeline system to minimize losses, or monitor when bins and expandable bins are full to maximize the fuel economy of garbage trucks. In terms of safety, testing the drinking capacity of local water sources such as lakes or streams can improve citywide health. Real-time monitoring of natural conditions and when they may deteriorate can help speed up evacuation and better guide resources in the event of disasters such as wildfires or flash floods. It really promotes the situation that everything can become part of the Internet of Things, and we as a society can benefit greatly from the Internet of Things. That is now and now. Fifty years from today?
<br>
When you try to comprehend by the end of the decade there will be approximately 30 billion devices included in the IoT, and then five years later, in 2025, 75 billion will be connected (Statista 2016), well, its mind boggling. But aside from more and more things coming online, what is the next evolution? Well, for one, advertising will be a lot more interactive. The voice -based services are already a mainstay at home with Amazon 's Alexa or Google' s Assistant.
<br>
The healthcare industry is beginning to undergo a fundamental shift as the Internet of things addresses the challenges of providing efficient, effective healthcare at a reasonable cost. Artificial intelligence, or ai, will also have a big impact as more devices connect and interact. Google's Voice AI Duplex is a good example. Effectively conferring the pitch and nuance of a human voice on a machine and connecting it to people you don't want or have time to talk to directly represents a huge leap forward in human-ai interaction.
<br>
</body>
<h3>What is the IoT impact? </h3>
<body>The number of connected devices has increased from 1 per person today to 10 per person in the future, which will open up many new opportunities for startups and create an ecosystem in the IOT region. Once you understand the business value of the Internet of Things, new products, services, and revenue models will emerge. These models will attract investment and thus create jobs in the Internet of Things. It is also possible to increase the import and export of such products and solutions, which in turn can promote economic development.
<br>
    The Internet connects people through commerce and social communication, or through commercial transactions such as Internet banking or e-commerce. On the other hand, the emerging Internet of things (IOT) is about connecting machines and systems with sensors and actuators that can collect meaningful information from these systems and take action to improve human productivity and efficiency. We're talking about the Internet of things driving the growth of connected devices, from about a billion today to more than 50 billion in the next decade. In doing so, the Internet of things takes interconnection to a whole new level.
    <br>
    While the Internet of things promises to improve efficiency while reducing waste, cost and inconvenience, the biggest attraction of this technology trend is that we will lead to a cleaner environment, higher productivity and better quality of life.
    <br>
    According to Sridhar Iyengar (n.d.), some examples of these benefits are:
    <ul>
        <li>smarter homes and offices that can save on energy costs, or adjust the internal environment of buildings to suit the tastes and needs of residents, or provide better security measures such as continuous monitoring and proactive actions (such as alerting the local police) to prevent security violations.</li>
        <li>better health care is provided through remote monitoring of patients and even remote administration of medication</li>
        <li>reminders of routine work, such as paying utilities, parking meters, etc</li>
        <li>intelligent street lighting or automatic sensing and control of traffic signals</li>
        <li>remote monitoring of assembly lines and production systems to maximize the operational efficiency, reliability and safety of production facilities</li>
        <li>an intelligent vehicle that can be summoned for assistance if necessary to help control speed according to traffic and environmental conditions</li>
    </ul>

</body>
<h3>How will Iot affect us? </h3>
<body>The Internet of things will affect and change our lives in five ways.
    <br>
    <p>1.Your Home</p>
    For instance, the Amazon Echo is a voice-enabled speaker that connects to a virtual assistant called Alexa. Alexa answers your questions, plays music, provides you with the latest news and games. She can also control equipment in her home through a connected hub. So Alexa can even turn on the heat or dim the lights. All you need to do is connect your home to Alexa and you can control almost any appliance in your home by simply asking
    <br>
    <p>2.Health</p>
    Wearable technology, known as smartwatches and wristbands, has entered the market in batches, providing users with a variety of personalized data about their health and fitness activities. Smartwatches can also track your calories burned, heart rate and a host of other health data. It's not just about staying in shape -- internet-of-things devices can help monitor overall health. There are already a number of smartphone apps that can monitor blood sugar levels for diabetes and other health data. Meanwhile, the second-generation iWatch and Simband include heart rate monitors and wellness trackers that doctors may use to optimize patient care.
    <p>3.Transportation</p>
    One of the best times to get online is when you travel. The problem is that you often can't get a signal (on a plane or underground) or if you can, the signal is always dropping (trains, coaches and cars). Connectivity will change that. It involves equipping the vehicle with wi-fi to enable Internet connectivity during travel. This is already common in China. Carmakers are investing heavily in connectivity technology. These will change the way we use cars. Road sensors warn drivers of dangerous driving conditions, help them find parking Spaces and even seek help in the event of a crash.
    <p>4.Environment</p>
    Anything that can help us reduce waste must be accepted. To a lesser extent, this includes smart home meters to reduce our energy use. On a larger scale, this extends to sensors that absorb rising water levels in rivers to prevent flooding, or detect sewage to stop it from being dumped into the sea. Furthermore, WaterBee.eu is an irrigation system that saves water for farmers, golf courses and vineyards by monitoring soil moisture (Szondy,D 2013).
    <p>5.Business</p>
    The Internet of things also helps companies optimize in a number of ways. Some stores are already using signals from shoppers' smartphones to track their in-store behavior and pair them with online data to get the most in-depth customer profiles. Retailers with apps can then use the data to send coupons and special promotional materials to customers' phones at the best time and place. It's not just about optimizing marketing. Iot device sensors are already used to monitor machines and notify businesses of parts that are malfunctioning or in need of repair. SightMachine's products include a range of sensors, cameras and lasers that can be used to monitor the manufacturing process to ensure quality.
