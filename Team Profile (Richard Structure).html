       <p>Hello! I'm Richard Forsey, and my student number is 3857811.I'm an Australian born and raised in Melbourne who has also spent three years living overseas in Saint Petersburg, Russia. When I left high school, I had the belief that I wanted to become a scientist specializing in the areas of nanotechnology and biotechnology. However, my first discovery as a scientist, during my honors year, was that the reality of being a scientist did not match at all what I had imagined. <br> Afterwards, a friend suggested that I do a CELTA (a certificate of teaching English as a second language). After some consideration I decided to do it and the first chosen destination was Russia. I had intended to stay there for only one year or so, but I ended up staying for the full three years I had planned to teach overseas. After a year of working in the ESL industry in Melbourne, I decided a change of career was very much needed.</p>
