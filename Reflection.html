  <h2>Individual Reflections</h2>
  <h3>Richard's Perception</h3>
  <p>In my view, the group worked very well together. Team memebers compelted tasks quickly and didn't shirk responsibility. What could have been improved however was my direction. In hindsight, I should have made much more granular divisions of tasks, prepared a "tasks list" for each team-memeber and then had an individual meeting with them to discuss the list, ensure comprehension of goals, and clarify my intentions for the final result's form. Also, by doing this further formalization of the work process, keeping track of memeber progress would have been much faster, and in the situation where a teamate was availible for work, I could have shifted a task over to them much more clearly.</p>
  <p>Having worked in university-level group projects, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of work provided by my teammates, and the speed of which they would respond. Something that I learned about working in a group in this project was the importance of filling the "small unit leadership" position. From speaking with people in other groups, they have noted issues with the group having a lack of iniative, direction and vision, which is not the case for us here. I also noted that in meetings I was the driving personality (which is fine), and if I was to "step back" from the focus, others would be unwilling to take the limelight. To be fair, I am older than them by about a decade, so the greater life experienc that I ahve makes me more confident.</p>
  <p>The GitHuB activities log was a fair reflection of the group's work, as we ported our content onto the platform early on and performed later updates via GitHub.</p>

  <h3>Jai's Perception</h3>
  <p> I believe our team worked exceptionally well together. This has by far been the best experience I've had working in a team. In the past when working in a team any larger than 3 people, there was always somebody not doing their assigned work and forcing others to pick up the slack. Sure sometimes team members struggled with certain tasks but they always tried. That was very refreshing. Our team seemed to pretty naturally mesh and work well together, and there were no disputes. I could do with improving my planing skills - I left some of my work a bit late and found myself rushing in the last few days. As a group we should work on keeping a consistent style with our HTML. This is not just limited to CSS, but also stuff like heading sizes and other stylistic and structural parts. </p>

  <h3>Tim's Perception</h3>
  <p>As a part of a team, I found that when there is a good team leader, everything becomes very simple, everything is orderly, and can be handed over to GitHub on time. Everyone can see other people's parts and make changes. This is what a group needs to do and it is responsible for everyone. I think our project will do better if we can hand in the task earlier and finish it rather than submit the job at the last time. I was very surprised at our team leader. I didn't expect that a good team leader could bring us so much convenience. It turns out that a good team leader plays a very important role in a group. Without Richard, we would have been scattered. In this project, I learned how to arrange my time reasonably. Because other subjects also have tasks, I have to complete all things in a limited time. Time management is very important. Reasonable distribution of rest and study time is the most valuable thing I learned this time. I am very lucky to be a member of the group, and I have learned a lot of useful and valuable knowledge on the way to cooperate with the group.</p>

  <h3>Wen's Perception</h3>
  <p>We have made a corresponding contribution to this assignment. The good thing we do is to distribute the tasks reasonably so that everyone can have enough opportunities to complete the task. It would be good if we could’ve started a bit earlier, which would have given us more time to finish everything off nicely and more time to plan all the parts of the assignment. The most surprising thing to me is how well our group went when we did the assignment as we respect each other’s work, provide the solution for group members and everyone put a lot of effort into the assignment. Furthermore, we became more familiar with using GitHub and we also pushed as much as our works into gitHub.</p>

  <h2>Group Reflection</h2>
  <p>I dunno, that's just like, your opinion, man.</p>
