    <p>Hello! I'm Richard Forsey, and my student number is 3857811.I'm an Australian born and raised in Melbourne who has also spent three years living overseas in Saint Petersburg, Russia. When I left high school, I had the belief that I wanted to become a scientist specializing in the areas of nanotechnology and biotechnology. However, my first discovery as a scientist, during my honors year, was that the reality of being a scientist did not match at all what I had imagined. Afterwards, a friend suggested that I do a CELTA (a certificate of teaching English as a second language). After some consideration I decided to do it and the first chosen destination was Russia. I had intended to stay there for only one year or so, but I ended up staying for the full three years I had planned to teach overseas. After a year of working in the ESL industry in Melbourne, I decided a change of career was very much needed.

    <p>Hello, my name is Timothy Pan(s3846342),my email is s3846342@student.rmit.edu.au.I was born in New Zealand. When I was 4 years old, my parents and I returned to China and settled in China. When I was 16, I came to Australia and started my high school life. Because my parents are all Chinese, therefore I also speak Chinese at home. My family member also has a lovely pug. His name is Bruce. My favourite thing every day is to play in the backyard with Bruce. He is a very lovely Pug and of course Bruce snores when he sleeps.

    <p>Hi this is Jai Wells, and my student number is S3785420.I was born here in Victoria in the year 2000. I attended McClelland Secondary College in Frankston, graduating in 2018. While at McClelland, I studied software development, business management, legal studies, further maths and philosophy. During my junior years at McClelland I also studied Japanese... but I don't remember much of it anymore. My main hobby is custom PC building, particularly small form factor PCs. This is my current PC featuring a Ryzen 7 3700x CPU and a GTX 1070 GPU, paired with 32GB DDR4 RAM and 1.5TB of SSD storage. My case is a Nouvolo Steck which is 8.7L in volume, most full size PC cases are about 40L.I've also been getting into reading recently. One of my favourite books at the moment is The Martian by Andy Weir (Adapted into a movie staring Matt Damon, both the book and movie are really good.)

    <p>Hello, I'm Chen Guanhong. I am a 100% Chinese. After graduating from college, I worked for a while and found that I wanted to continue studying. After much consideration, I decided to come to Australia and learn IT-related knowledge. In the near future, I hope to become a cybersecurity Engineer, because I admire the profession of hacking very much, but after all it is illegal. by the way I like the Australian air and environment, although my nose suffers from pollen every day.</p>

    <p>My introversion means I will be a strong independent learner and once set to a task I should be able to go and do it without further input. I may struggle to express my opinions when required. My empathy means I can look for signs of stress among the team and try to help out. My self discipline should help me avoid falling behind the pace of my team. Strong problem solving skills mean I can provide input to my teammates and perhaps solve some of their problems using my fresh pair of eyes.

    <p>According to the results of the test report, I am an explorer. The explorer is always looking for ways to balance work and leisure. The explorer lets himself complete all the tasks before relaxing himself. This may seem lazy to some, but it doesn't have to be. The seeker's ability to balance work and play can help them avoid burnout. Ultimately, this can help them enjoy a greater sense of accomplishment in their lives and, yes, ultimately lead to amazing productivity. I couldn't agree more. I'd rather work as part of a team than as a person. Moreover, I like challenging tasks, so I chose the difficult part, the IT technologies, in this assignment. This part requires a lot of research and analysis, and a 2,000-word report. As hard as it is, I am willing to work for my team as part of the team</p>

    <p>The result from Myer-Briggs test indicates my personality type is “Adventurer” which is very high in Imaginative, feeling, Sensitive to Others, Passionate, and Curious. Hence, I can easily relate to others’ emotions, which I am capable of getting well with my team members, helping them to establish harmony and goodwill, and minimize conflict. At the same time, work hard to finish my task and also respect and care for my colleagues. I also have weaknesses, which are Easily Stressed and lack of long term plans. That means sometimes I may rely on my team leader too much, so I have to become more independent and learn to relieve stress. The learning style test suggests that I am an auditory which I usually learn from hearing and listening, thus, I might be very good at listening to clients' needs and implement it correctly. I may also be good at listening to my team members’ ideas and respect them. But the result points out that I may not be willing to talk much, so I do need a team member that is willing to do the talking part. The result from the big five personality shows that I am high in openness, high in conscientiousness, high in extraversion, high in agreeableness but low in neuroticism. Therefore, I am a person tendency to think in a complex, creative way and I am able to self-discipline in order to pursue my goals. I am a caring person who will always consider others' needs. However, I could be sensitive sometimes, so it would be better for me to work with someone that is open-minded and respects others opinions.
