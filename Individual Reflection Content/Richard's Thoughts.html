<h2>Richard's Perception</h2>
<p>In my view, the group worked very well together. Team memebers compelted tasks quickly and didn't shirk responsibility. What could have been improved however was my direction. In hindsight, I should have made much more granular divisions of tasks, prepared a "tasks list" for each team-memeber and then had an individual meeting with them to discuss the list, ensure comprehension of goals, and clarify my intentions for the final result's form. Also, by doing this further formalization of the work process, keeping track of memeber progress would have been much faster, and in the situation where a teamate was availible for work, I could have shifted a task over to them much more clearly.</p>
<p>Having worked in university-level group projects, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of work provided by my teammates, and the speed of which they would respond. Something that I learned about working in a group in this project was the importance of filling the "small unit leadership" position. From speaking with people in other groups, they have noted issues with the group having a lack of iniative, direction and vision, which is not the case for us here. I also noted that in meetings I was the driving personality (which is fine), and if I was to "step back" from the focus, others would be unwilling to take the limelight. To be fair, I am older than them by about a decade, so the greater life experienc that I ahve makes me more confident.</p>
<p>The GitHuB activities log was a fair reflection of the group's work, as we ported our content onto the platform early on and performed later updates via GitHub.</p>
