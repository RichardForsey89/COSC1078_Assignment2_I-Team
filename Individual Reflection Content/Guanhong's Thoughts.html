<h2>Guanhong's Perception</h2>
<p>I think we worked very well together on this assignment, and everyone did their part very well, although sometimes it was difficult for us to agree on web design. We did a great job of communicating, we were very clear about our tasks, and GitHub made it easier for us to keep track of everyone's progress. But if we had done the HTML part earlier we would have had more time to talk about the CSS part. I was very surprised by Richard's leadership. He was an excellent leader and he organized us well. I have never used GitHub before, but in this assignment my teammates have taught me how to use it, which has benefited me a lot</p>
