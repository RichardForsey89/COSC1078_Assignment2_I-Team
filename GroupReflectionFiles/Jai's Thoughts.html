<h2>Jai's Perception</h2>
<p>
    I believe our team worked exceptionally well together. This has by far been the best experience I've had working in a team. In the past when working in a team any larger than
    3 people, there was always somebody not doing their assigned work and forcing others to pick up the slack. Sure sometimes team members struggled with certain tasks but 
    they always tried. That was very refreshing. Our team seemed to pretty naturally mesh and work well together, and there were no disputes. I could do with improving my planing 
    skills - I left some of my work a bit late and found myself rushing in the last few days. As a group we should work on keeping a consistent style with our HTML. This is 
    not just limited to CSS, but also stuff like heading sizes and other stylistic and structural parts.
