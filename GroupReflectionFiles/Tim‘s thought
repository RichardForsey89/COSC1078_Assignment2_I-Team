<h1>Group Reflection  Tim</h1>
<p>As a part of a team, I found that when there is a good team leader, everything becomes very simple, everything is orderly, and can be handed over to GitHub on time. Everyone can see other people's parts and make changes. This is what a group needs to do and it is responsible for everyone. I think our project will do better if we can hand in the task earlier and finish it rather than submit the job at the last time. I was very surprised at our team leader. I didn't expect that a good team leader could bring us so much convenience. It turns out that a good team leader plays a very important role in a group. Without Richard, we would have been scattered. In this project, I learned how to arrange my time reasonably. Because other subjects also have tasks, I have to complete all things in a limited time. Time management is very important. Reasonable distribution of rest and study time is the most valuable thing I learned this time. I am very lucky to be a member of the group, and I have learned a lot of useful and valuable knowledge on the way to cooperate with the group.</p>
