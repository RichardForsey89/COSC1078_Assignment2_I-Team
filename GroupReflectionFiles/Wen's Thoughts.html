<h2>
<p>We have made a corresponding contribution to this assignment. The good thing we do is to distribute the tasks reasonably so that everyone can have enough opportunities to complete the task. </p>
<p>It would be good if we could’ve started a bit earlier, which would have given us more time to finish everything off nicely and more time to plan all the parts of the assignment.</p>
<p>The most surprising thing is how well our group went when we did the assignment as we respect each other’s work, provide the solution for group members and everyone put a lot of effort into the assignment. Furthermore, we became more familiar with using GitHub and we also pushed as much as our works into gitHub.</p>
