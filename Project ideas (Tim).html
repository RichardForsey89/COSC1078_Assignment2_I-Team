    <h1>Project ideas</h1>
        <p>After group discussion and consideration of many factors, our group decided to choose Richard's idea. We think his idea can bring great help to the society. The product will initially be implemented for the benefit of the school concerned and, if successful, will then be expanded into a service that can be sold to other educational institutions. The product will have two main parts, the student oriented part and the internal school part. In the student part, students will be given a list of courses to choose from. They can choose to stay at the current level of English, or take more advanced English courses.<br>

        Students can also access descriptions of classroom focus and objectives at any time. The second part is the teacher part, through which the teacher can get the basic information of the students, English level and so on. According to the courses chosen by the students, there will be corresponding teachers to explain them. Of course, jobs and tests still need to be manually modified. Of course, students can change their English learning courses at any time, which does not conflict.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The advantage of this software is to save teachers and students a lot of time. The wasted time can be used in more places, such as improving the quality of class, more in-depth understanding of students' needs and so on.</p>
        <p>This application will be programmed in Java because it is multi platform and suitable for this use case.
        </p>
        <p>Richard's idea is to solve the situation that the school is busy when there are too many people too managing, and make the time more efficient. so that teachers can use more time in education, and students have more time to study.
        </p>
        <p>What people lack most now is the concept of time. Now people have made mistakes in time management because of the electronic products. Instead of being disturbed by electronic products, it's better to learn how to use it to manage time, which it is just  convenient and effective. This student class preference collector did help people save a lot of time,

        <p>Compared with other group ideas, the biggest similarity is that all ideas are a mobile phone software. Mobile phone  become a part of everyone's life, the design of mobile software can be very quickly accepted by people. And these mobile software can help people, make their lives more convenient. Just like our group's main idea, student class preference collector, this software has brought great convenience to teachers and students in school. Of course, the differences are obvious. Some of the ideas in the group can be realised now, such as Uber, and of course, other ideas that cannot be realised by current technology, such as animal communication devices.
        </p>
        <p>My idea is to design a mobile phone software similar to Uber to help others clean up. The biggest difference between my idea and that of the rest of the group is that this software creates a lot of jobs and provides a second chance for many unemployed people, just like Uber provides jobs for many drivers. Other ideas tend to make life easier, but mine is to help ease the employment problem. But in terms of feasibility, Richard's idea is the most practical.
