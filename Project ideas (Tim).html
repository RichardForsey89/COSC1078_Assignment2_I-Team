    <h1>Project ideas</h1>
        <p>After a group discussion and consideration of many factors, our group decided to choose Richard's idea. We think his idea would be very beneficial within its context and is the most feasible to compelte. The product will initially be implemented for the benefit of the school concerned and, if successful, could then be expanded into a service that can be sold to other educational institutions. The product will have two main parts, the student oriented part and the internal school part. <br>

        In the student part, students will be given a list of courses to choose from. They can choose to stay at the current level of English, or take more advanced English courses.Students can also access descriptions of classroom focus and objectives at any time. <br>

        The second internal school part is how the school staff can get the basic information of the students, English level and so on. According to the courses chosen by the students, there will be corresponding teachers to explain them. Of course, jobs and tests still need to be manually modified. Of course, students can change their English learning courses at any time, which does not conflict.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The advantage of this software is to save teachers and students a lot of time. This wasted time can be used in more places, such as improving the quality of class, more in-depth understanding of students' needs and so on.</p>
        <p>This application will be programmed in Java because it is multi platform and suitable for this use case.
        </p>
        <p>Richard's idea is to solve the issue that occurs when students are making thier class selections for the next session of classes. The management of this process detracts from class time, and the implementation of the preferences totally absorbs the attention of the director of studies for a few days. It would be better to make this process more effective, so that teachers can spend more class time on education, students have more time to learn and management can perform other duties.
        </p>
        <p>What people lack most now is the concept of time. Now people have made mistakes in time management because of the electronic products. Instead of being disturbed by electronic products, it's better to learn how to use it to manage time, which it is just  convenient and effective. This student class preference collector did help people save a lot of time,
        </p>
        <p>One of the biggest problems in it and computing in 2020 is information security. In the past few years, there have been many information leaks, even the international giants apple and Samsung are not immune. Of course, the student class preference collector will work hard to avoid information disclosure. This software will bring in many sensitive information of students, such as home address, telephone number and so on. As software developers, our responsibility is to protect these information from being leaked. First of all, teachers need to be trained and sign a confidentiality contract to view the information of students. No one other than teachers and school employees has the right to view the information. Protecting the privacy of students is the main responsibility of this software. We need to build a safe and simple software.</p>
